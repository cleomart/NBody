# NBody
![](https://github.com/cleomart/NBody/blob/master/planetspartyimage.png)

This program simulates N motion of objects in a plane which accounts for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newtonâ€™s Law of Universal Gravitation.

This project was created for CS 61BL (Data Structures) at UC Berkeley Summer 2018.

## Installations
To run the application, clone the repository on your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/cleomart/NBody.git
```
Then go inside the repository and compile `Nbody.java`.
```
javac NBody.java
```
Run the simulation with the following template:
```
java NBody <T> <dt> data/<file>
```
where 

- `T` is the time interval in which we update the position of our planets and redraw the universe

- `dt` is a small period of time when planet's velocity changes

- `file` is the name of the file that contains the universe we want to stimulate. There are many other universes you can choose from in `data` folder.

Here are a couple of examples:

```
java NBody 166880000.0 100000.0 data/planets.txt

java NBody 20000000 20000 ./data/massive-squirrel-battle.txt

java NBody 20000000 20000 ./data/illusion.txt 

java NBody 20000000 20000 ./data/kaleidoscope.txt 

```
